### Problem Definition and Proposed Solution Overview
The main problem that we identified was the inconvenience of the first class software, which all students and faculty at Horace Mann use as their communication system. In particular, we noticed an overload of emails that students and teachers were receiving, especially from clubs. Our goal for our new app was to solve this problem. Some of the things that our app aims to solve is the proposing and answering of polls (as we noticed that the bulk of students’ emails were coming from polls), and the scheduling of club meetings as we noticed that it may contribute to the unorganization of First Class.

### Contextual Inquiry Results & Key Tasks
We conducted many contextual inquiries through our testing process to figure out what would be most helpful to have in our app. We began planning our topic by investigating issues related to communication at Horace Mann. We pretty quickly realized that most of the issues stem from the first class email system we use at HM. So, we zoomed in on problems with first class communication, and based our contextual inquiry around this. We tested with 2 students and 1 teacher to gain insight about what are the major grievances they have with the current first class communication system at HM. As we got more comfortable with doing contextual inquiries, we learned that, unlike a classic interview, to be most successful, we should take a back seat to allow the person we tested with to show us activities they typically do and answer some guiding questions. The users mostly discussed that they were being flooded with many emails that were not relevant to them, as well as having difficulty getting poll results if they needed to send out a poll. We ended up identifying a few main tasks that our app is geared to, which include sending out polls for club leaders (also on the flip side, filling out polls) and finding club rooms for I period meetings.  

### Initial Paper Prototype
This was our original paper prototype: 
The critical parts of this design include the main page (image on the top row, second column) which is the page that has all the different buttons that lets the user go to the subsequent pages. Through this main page, the user can achieve the two tasks which include sending out polls (also on the flip side, filling out polls) by having a page for people who want to have polls to input the question and answer options, and also finding club rooms, which is done through starring the clubs that pertain to the user, which would have a club room labelled next to it.

### Usability Testing Process & Results
We tested 3 participants who are all HM students. As we conducted more tests, we realized that the most efficient way to perform them is to ensure we say as little as possible to allow the user to narrate everything as they went through the app. We did not make any drastic changes since we put a lot of thought into our first prototype to ensure it would make the most sense. Thus, most of the changes were about clarification of our prototype and how to make the design the most straightforward for users. Some changes we made included adding instructions for specific pages to make it clearer for users, as what was intuitive and clear to us was definitely not the case for users who were looking at our app for the first time. For example, for the club room page, we added instructions because the users had expressed confusion on this page about what to do and how to use it. Another change was for the Schedule Club meeting page, where we added a space for the person to add information about the club so users can clearly know what will happen in each meeting. This change was also quite significant since it was a really good suggestion from the user as it would allow students to decide whether they want to go to certain meetings. We also clarified some symbols that users had said were unclear, which were mostly small cosmetic changes. 

### Final Paper Prototype
The 2 tasks that we honed in on are sending out polls and finding club rooms. For the most part, the critical aspects of our initial design remained constant for our final one. Our home page, the place where you can perform our 2 primary tasks (finding a club room and sending out a poll), remained the same as we noticed that users had little to no problem navigating through this page. Thus, the main steps on how to send out a poll or find a club room remained the same from before.

### Digital Mockup & Testing Results
#### Task 1:  Sending out polls 
  This task is completed when the user presses on the main page, and presses the “Send out a Poll” button on the bottom left. This brings the user to the Publish a Poll page , where they input their email, the questions, answer choices and if the polls are anonymous. After that, they will submit it and it brings them to the thank you page, which brings them back to the main page.
#### Task 2:  Finding club rooms.
  This task is completed when the user presses on the main page, and presses the club room pages. Then, they can scroll to find their club and the club room, paying attention to only what pertains to them. On this page, they can return to the main page, or go to the schedule of a club meeting page. The manner in which users complete this task changed quite a bit from our paper prototype, which we decided that the other system was too confusing for the user and harder to indicate on Balsamiq as well. Thus, we took the “less is more” approach to simplify the design. 
  
Another change we made was adding some more details we left out on the paper prototype, such as expanding the list of clubs, adding more options to the schedule a club meeting page etc. 
For the final round of testing, we conducted another usability test with a HM student, as this is our targeted user base for our app.We used a similar process as before for testing because we feel like we were able to get a good understanding on how to use this manner of testing with our three previous users. We conducted this usability test with a junior in the library during I period, which mimics the busy time for students when they likely would be checking their email for club rooms. We encouraged the student to narrate everything he thought about our prototype. 

### Discussion
Through this process of iterative design, our main take-away was that there can always be something to improve on. We realized that even though we were a group of three people, the opinions that we gathered from other people were extremely helpful in terms of gaining perspective over what our user wants. Ultimately, our main motivation for why we created this app was to create as much impact on our users as possible. In order to make sure that this actually happens, this means gathering opinions from various users, and taking into account what they think would make for the most effective app. Our last usability test revealed that the user found our digital mockup quite straightforward to use, and did not express any huge confusions or complaints about our prototype.

The process shaped our design by clarifying and making our design more straightforward for the user. With our initial design, we noticed that some of the things that we thought were clear and straight-forward turned out to be difficult to navigate through for some other users. Revisions ranged from a deletion of a confusing button, an addition of directions, etc. Through each iteration of our design, we ensured that each revision made it so our app was easy and clear to use, so that our final design was as clear as possible. 

We think that our design process was very informative and effective, and we were able to create a final prototype that we are proud of. Yet, at the same time, we could also have had more iterations of different designs since most of our iterations included revisions to our existing design. In this way, we would have been able to exchange more ideas.

If we were to pursue HM Comms further and release it to the public, we would aim to create a version of this app that is not particular to Horace Mann, but also for other schools, or possibly to the general public. We would generalize the polls that are specifically tailored to HM in HM Comms to allow people to publish polls related to anything. In this version of the app, we would separate the various polls into different categories. Some examples of categories can be like food, school, technology, science, miscellaneous, etc. Ultimately, we would keep the same concept of allowing users to publish polls, and separating those polls into categories. That would fulfill the task of sending out polls. Another feature that we can possibly do is to put locations to post various stores, malls, and other locations. One experiment that we can conduct is to see what some of the most common categories are. We can conduct research to see if the app could apply in other settings, such as perhaps in work spaces, so that more people could use this app.
