Through generating issues at HM in order to create a prototype, to testing with users and finalizing our digital prototype, I’ve learned a lot about the design process this year through Mobile Apps. In this manifesto, I’ll touch upon the 5 key aspects that enabled my group to create our final prototype.  
  
## Personal code of ethics

#### Accountability, fairness, and transparency 
During this year, as we learned about the potential and influence of technology, I learned more about my own beliefs regarding technology, and how to best regulate it. In my opinion, technology should always be used with good intentions, for example, to help make something easier for someone. I recently edited an article for our school publication, Spectrum, which included faculty and student opinions at HM about ethics in Machine Learning. (The issue will be published soon, check it out when it comes out!) While editing it, I read about many different opinions as well as previous examples where Machine Learning has failed in the past. The writer of this article determined the best way to ensure technology remains regulated is through accountability, fairness and transparency. These three things are crucial to ensure that technology is used only for good intentions, and when it is not, there is a way to deal with it. Here is a preview of the article.

#### Especially transparency
Specific to our group, this meant creating an app with the intention of helping students and teachers at HM receive a little less clutter in their first class email system. When creating systems such as the poll function in our app, we made sure the user put in their email address so that in case someone submits something inappropriate, it could easily be tracked. As this is an app for school used by students primarily, transparency is a key component in our app to ensure everything remains school appropriate. 

## Spend Time Brainstorming using Specific Methods
Before  taking this class, I had imagined in the process of creating an app, the main component would be coding the actual app. However, in this thinking, I had ignored the many steps that come before this step: brainstorming to come up with an idea. This year, I’ve learned that brainstorming is so crucial before any big project. Further, brainstorming isn't just a process of passively sitting and coming up with ideas. Brainstorming efficiently by using specific strategies is key. These mechanisms may include a Fly on the Wall method, placing yourself in another person’s shoes (for us that was Carl Trombone), or inventing a specific persona to come up with ideas. In this class, the ideas were problems that an app could help fix. These activities allowed us to come up with concrete examples and issues that an app would actually be very helpful. Had we not spent time actively brainstorming, we likely would not have focued in on such specific issues.

## Don't Settle, Keep Thinking
After we had narrowed our app down to 2 central tasks, the members of our group came up with a first very rough prototype that we all agreed on. It seemed like the easiest way to set up the app and came to our minds quickly. Since we all agreed on it, we almost had decided to just go with this first design. This design was based around a “tab system” and while it was a decent way to organize our information, it was also the most straightforward, and we came up with it automatically. Here is the idea we first came up with:

We almost went with this design until we had to come up with 3 different sketches for our possible app. At this stage, we had to think a little deeper and come up with creative new ways to deliver all the information in our app.  This stage forced us to not just be content with our first idea, but to go deeper and come up with a product that ended up making a lot more sense and ended up being more comprehensive.

## Take Yourself Out of the Picture
As the three of us worked closely on the app, our mindset and view of our prototype soon began to merge. For instance, as mentioned earlier, when we all created the first rough prototype, since we had come up with ideas together, it was no surprise that our first prototypes were very similar. This similarity is great as it means we were in unison and on the same page, but it also can serve as a blinder. When people are in accordance like this, outside perspective can get lost. For example, in our prototype, everything made sense to us. However, after conferring with other people, either through tests or literally by chatting with others outside our immediate group, we were able to see big things we missed that made sense to us but not others. For example, with the clubs page, we had believed it was easy to use, but in reality, it turned out to be very unclear for everyone else.

## Incorporating accessibility for designing technological solutions: Test with Many Different Types of Users 

This point takes the previous Take Yourself Out of the Picture point one step further. In order to create the best product, whatever it may be, testing with a variety of users is crucial. This is not only important to gain a myriad of perspectives on an issue, but also to ensure the design is accessible and easy to use for everyone. 
#### Testing Users:
  Testing users consist of contextual inquiries, interviews etc, that each have a unique set of qualities. For contextual inquiries, our group found they were extremely helpful in the user providing honest critiques and feedback about our app while they merely narrated their thoughts.
For example, as seen in our table of revisions we made after testing with users, and through the first paper prototype to our final digital prototype, we changed many things with the goal of making our app easier to use. These changes allowed the app to be more accessible to everyone. 
#### Other Changes to Be Made
Additionally, as seen in the website: having simpler displays, easy to read colors, clear instructions will help the design for any product be most accessible to all.

These 5 components were crucial in aiding my group’s development and design of our app, HM Comms. Our group had gone through steps 2-5 chronologically, as that is how our design process laid out.
