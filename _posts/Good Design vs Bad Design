An example of a ![good design] (https://www.niemanlab.org/images/nytimes-for-you-3-wide.jpg) is the section of the New York Times App that is customized "for you." 
This section allows you to find topics that interest you. This app affords the user with choices that appeal to them, since they can customize what appears here. 
There are clear signifiers, since the tab is named "For You", users easily realize this a section that they can customize.
