![good design](https://www.niemanlab.org/images/nytimes-for-you-3-wide.jpg) An example of a good design is the section of the New York Times App that is customized "for you." 
This section allows you to find topics that interest you. This app affords the user with news articles that appeal to them, since they can customize what appears here. 
There are clear signifiers, since the tab is named "For You", users easily realize this a section that they can customize. 
The mapping is also clear, as the titles of the articles clearly lead to the full version of that article.
One limitation is that I don't think you can change the order of the articles, so the user may have to scroll a bit to find the topic they are looking for. 


![bad design](Screen Shot 2020-09-24 at 4.24.41 PM.png) On the other hand, an example of a bad design is one aspect of the site Peason. 
I used it this weekend for my homework and one small things that made me realize this site does not haev the best design is that it has bad feedback. 
After clicking on an activity, it would take up to a minute for the activity to load, which made it inconvienient and slow. 
I have to use this site for homework and the slow feedback makes it hard to use, especially if I accidentally click on a link because then I have to wait a while to exit. 
While it has clear signifiers since each section is labelled, joining the Pearsons classroom can be confusing and the mapping is unclear as it had different links that led the user to the same site.  
The actual image shown here is formatted in a clear way; however it is the links and the feedback that are flawed.
